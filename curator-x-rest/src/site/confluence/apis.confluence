h2. Status APIs

||URL||Method||Request Entity||Response Entity||Description||
|/curator/v1/client/status|GET|n/a|Status|Call to get the status of the Curator connection as well as any pending messages.|
|/curator/v1/client/status|POST|List of string ids|Status|Call to get the status of the Curator connection as well as any pending messages. Additionally, stateful instances with the specified IDs are "touched" thus preventing timeout expiration.|

h2. Client APIs

||URL||Method||Request Entity||Response Entity||Description||
|/curator/v1/client/get-children|POST|GetChildrenSpec|Array of strings|This is the equivalent of CuratorFramework.getChildren().|
|/curator/v1/client/create|POST|CreateSpec|PathAndId|This is the equivalent of CuratorFramework.create().|
|/curator/v1/client/delete|POST|DeleteSpec|n/a|This is the equivalent of CuratorFramework.delete().|
|/curator/v1/client/set-data|POST|SetDataSpec|n/a|This is the equivalent of CuratorFramework.setData().|
|/curator/v1/client/get-data|POST|GetDataSpec|DataAndStat|This is the equivalent of CuratorFramework.setData().|
|/curator/v1/client/exists|POST|ExistsSpec|ZK Stat or empty|This is the equivalent of CuratorFramework.exists().|

h3. How Asynchronous APIs Are Handled

For async versions of the Client APIs, the result is returned via a Status Message. See the [[Managing Status|client.html]] section for details
as well as the [[Status Messages|status.html]] page which details the Asynchronous Client APIs messages.

h3. How Watchers Are Handled

If you set "isWatched" to true in a Client API, a status message is generated when the watcher fires. See the [[Managing Status|client.html]]
section for details as well as the [[Status Messages|status.html]] page which details the Watchers message.

h3. How Ephemeral Nodes Are Handled

If you create an ephemeral node using the Client APIs, you must periodically send a heartbeat with the ID of the ephemeral node (as
returned by the API). See the [[Client Page|client.html]] for details. IMPORTANT: if you fail to send heartbeats within the configured
session length, the Curator REST Proxy will delete the ephemeral node (sending an expiration status message).

h2. Recipe APIs

| *Leader* | | | | |
|/curator/v1/recipes/leader|POST|LeaderSpec|Id|Start a LeaderLatch instance. When you gain leadership, it will be notified via status.|

|/curator/v1/recipes/leader/{leader-id}|GET|n/a|array of ParticipantSpecs|List of participants in the leader election.|
| *Lock* | | | | |
|/curator/v1/recipes/lock|POST|LockSpec|Id|An InterProcessSemaphoreMutex. On successful return, your client will be holding the specified lock until you delete the lock via the delete API.|
|/curator/v1/recipes/lock/{lock-id}|DELETE|n/a|n/a|Release and delete a lock.|
| *Read/Write Lock* | | | | |
|/curator/v1/recipes/read-write-lock/read|POST|LockSpec|Id|An InterProcessReadWriteLock. On successful return, your client will be holding the specified read lock until you delete the lock via the delete API.|
|/curator/v1/recipes/read-write-lock/write|POST|LockSpec|Id|An InterProcessReadWriteLock. On successful return, your client will be holding the specified write lock until you delete the lock via the delete API.|
|/curator/v1/recipes/read-write-lock/{lock-id}|DELETE|n/a|n/a|Release and delete the read/write lock.|
| *Semaphore* | | | | |
|/curator/v1/recipes/semaphore|POST|SemaphoreSpec|Id|An InterProcessSemaphoreV2. On successful return, your client will be holding the specified number of leases until you delete them via the delete API.|
|/curator/v1/recipes/semaphore/{lock-id}/{release-qty}|DELETE|n/a|n/a|Release the specified number of leases.|
| *Node Cache* | | | | |
|/curator/v1/recipes/node-cache|POST|NodeCacheSpec|Id|Start a NodeCache instance. NodeCache updates will be notified via status.|
|/curator/v1/recipes/node-cache/{cache-id}|GET|n/a|OptionalNodeData|Get the current node value.|
|/curator/v1/recipes/node-cache/{cache-id}|DELETE|n/a|n/a|Stop and delete a node cache.|
| *Path Cache* | | | | |
|/curator/v1/recipes/path-cache|POST|PathChildrenCacheSpec|Id|Start a PathChildrenCache instance. PathChildrenCache updates will be notified via status.|

|/curator/v1/recipes/path-cache/{cache-id}/{full-path}|GET|n/a|OptionalNodeData|Return the current cached value for the node at the specified full path.|
|/curator/v1/recipes/path-cache/{cache-id}|DELETE|n/a|n/a|Stop and delete a path cache.|
| *Persistent Ephemeral Node* | | | | |
|/curator/v1/recipes/persistent-ephemeral-node|POST|PersistentEphemeralNodeSpec|Id|Start a PersistentEphemeralNode instance.|
