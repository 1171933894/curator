h2. Components

|[[Framework|curator-framework/index.html]]|The Curator Framework is a high-level API that greatly simplifies using ZooKeeper. It adds many features that build on ZooKeeper and handles the complexity of managing connections to the ZooKeeper cluster and retrying operations.|
|[[Recipes|curator-recipes/index.html]]|Implementations of some of the common ZooKeeper "recipes". The implementations are built on top of the Curator Framework.|
|[[Utilities|utilities.html]]|Various utilities that are useful when using ZooKeeper.|
|[[Client|curator-client/index.html]]|A replacement for the bundled {{ZooKeeper}} class that takes care of some low-level housekeeping and provides some useful utilities.|
|[[Errors]]|How Curator deals with errors, connection issues, recoverable exceptions, etc.|
|[[Extensions]]|Optional/extension recipes for vertical uses.|

h2. Maven / Artifacts

Curator binaries are published to Maven Central. Curator consists of several artifacts. Which artifacts to use depends on your needs. For
most users, the only artifact you need is {{curator-recipes}}.

|org.apache.curator|curator-recipes|All of the recipes. Note: this artifact has dependencies on client and framework and, so, Maven (or whatever tool you're using) should pull those in automatically.|

|org.apache.curator|curator-client|The Curator Client - replacement for the ZooKeeper class in the ZK distribution.|
