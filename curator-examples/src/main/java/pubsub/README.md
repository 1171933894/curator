# Pub-Sub Example
This example models a publish and subscribe system (note: it is not meant for production) using the strongly typed modeled APIs in Apache Curator. 

## Design Notes

In this example, there are three models that can be published: `Instance`, `LocationAvailable` and `UserCreated`. Instances have an `InstanceType`; LocationAvailable and UserCreated both have a `Priority` and are associated with a `Group`. (Note: these names/objects are meant for illustrative purposes only and are completely contrived)

Each model is stored at a unique path in ZooKeeper:

* Instance: `/root/pubsub/instances/TYPE/ID`
* LocationAvailable: `/root/pubsub/messages/locations/GROUP/PRIORITY/ID`
* UserCreated: `/root/pubsub/messages/users/GROUP/PRIORITY/ID`

All models are stored using a TTL so that they automatically get deleted after 10 minutes.

## Clients, Models and Paths

This example uses the "typed" models (`TypedModelSpec`, etc.). The typed paths, models and clients are meant to be created early in your application and re-used as needed. Thus, you can model your ZooKeeper usage and the rest of your application can use them without worrying about correct paths, types, etc.

In the Pub-Sub example, the paths are defined in `Paths.java`, the model specs are defined in `ModelSpecs.java` and the client templates are defined in `Clients.java`.

### TypedZPath

`TypedZPath` is a template that produces a `ZPath` by applying parameters. Curator provides variants that accept from 1 to 10 parameters (`TypedZPath`, `TypedZPath2`, `TypedZPath3`, etc.).

In this example, the TypedZPaths are defined in `Paths.java`. E.g.

```
public static final TypedZPath2<Group, Priority> locationAvailablePath = 
    TypedZPath2.from(basePath + "/messages/locations/{id}/{id}");

```

This creates a TypedZPath that requires two parameters, a `Group` and a `Priority`. When the `resolved()` method is called with a group and priority, the "{id}" values are replaced in order.

### TypedModelSpec

`TypedModelSpec` is a template that produces a `ModelSpec` by applying parameters to the contained `TypedZPath`. Curator provides variants that accept from 1 to 10 parameters (`TypedModelSpec`, `TypedModelSpec2`, `TypedModelSpec3`, etc.).

In this example, the TypedModelSpecs are defined in `ModelSpecs.java`. E.g.

```
public static final TypedModelSpec<Instance, InstanceType> instanceModelSpec = 
    TypedModelSpec.from(builder(Instance.class), Paths.instancesPath);
```

The `builder()` method creates a ModelSpec builder. 

### TypedModeledFramework

`TypedModeledFramework` is a template that produces a `ModeledFramework` by applying parameters to the `TypedZPath` in the contained `TypedModelSpec`. Curator provides variants that accept from 1 to 10 parameters (`TypedModeledFramework`, `TypedModeledFramework2`, `TypedModeledFramework3`, etc.).

In this example, the TypedModelSpecs are defined in `Clients.java`. E.g.

```
public static final TypedModeledFramework<Instance, InstanceType> instanceClient = 
   TypedModeledFramework.from(ModeledFramework.builder(), ModelSpecs.instanceModelSpec)
```

## Publisher

`Publisher.java` shows how to use the ModeledFramework to write models. There are methods to write single instances and to write lists of instances in a transaction. Each publish method resolves the appropriate typed client and then calls its `set()` method with the given model.

## Subscriber

`Subscriber.java` uses CachedModeledFrameworks to listen for changes on the parent nodes for all of the models in this example. Each of the methods resolves the appropriate typed client and then starts the cache (via `cached()`).

## SubPubTest

`SubPubTest.java` is a class that exercises this example. 

* `start()` uses `Subscriber` to start a `CachedModeledFramework` for each combination of the Instance + InstanceType, LocationAvailable + Group + Priority, and UserCreated + Group + Priority. It then adds a simple listener to each cache that merely prints the class name and path whenever an update occurs (see `generalListener()`).
* `start()` also starts a scheduled task that runs every second. This task calls `publishSomething()`
* `publishSomething()` randomly publishes either a single Instance, LocationAvailable, UserCreated or a list of those.
