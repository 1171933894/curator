== DESCRIPTION

Curator is a set of Java libraries that make using Apache ZooKeeper much easier. While
ZooKeeper comes bundled with a Java client, using the client is non-trivial and error prone.

== DETAILS

Please see the doc at https://github.com/Netflix/curator/wiki

== VERSIONS

There are currently two version paths:
Curator 1.0.x will stay compatible with ZooKeeper 3.3.x
Curator 1.1.x+ will require ZooKeeper 3.4.x+
