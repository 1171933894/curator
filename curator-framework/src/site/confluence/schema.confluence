h1. Schema/Documentation Support

In larger ZooKeeper applications you will end with many paths to ZNodes that have specific meanings and
uses. E.g. "/myapp/clients/clusters/instances" or "/myapp/writers/locks". These paths can become unwieldy
and difficult to reason about. Ideally, you should have a simple way to commonly refer to these paths,
a way to validate how they are used, and a way to document what they are used for.

Curator provides a mechanism to:

* Document your ZooKeeper paths
* Validate operations on ZooKeeper paths
* Map a simple string to a ZooKeeper path

h2. Schema and SchemaSet

The basic specification is the Schema class:

|| Field || Type || Required || Description ||
| name | String | Y | A unique name for this schema |
| path | String | Y | A full path to a ZNode or a regex pattern to a ZNode |
| documentation | String | N | User displayable documentation for this schema |
| dataValidator | DataValidator | N | _see below_ |
| ephemeral | can/must/cannot | N | Whether the schema allows for ephemerals at the path |
| sequential | can/must/cannot | N | Whether the schema allows for sequentials at the path |
| watched | can/must/cannot | N | Whether the schema allows for watchers at the path |
| canBeDeleted | true/false | N | Whether the schema allows the path to be deleted |

All the Schema instances are combined into a SchemaSet and this can be set in the CuratorFrameworkFactory
when creating a CuratorFramework instance. Schemas in a SchemaSet are applied in the following order:

# Exact match on full path (i.e. non-regex)
# Match on the first regex path, searched in the order given to the SchemaSet constructor

h3. DataValidator

DataValidators are used to optionally validate the data of a ZNode when the node is created or
data is being set. It is a functor of the form:

{code}
boolean isValid(String path, byte[] data);
{code}

h2. Getting ZNode paths/schemas by name

Use SchemaSets to access ZNode paths by a simple name. E.g.

{code}
CuratorFramework client = ...
String path = SchemaSet.getNamedPath(client, "locks");
{code}

h2. Loading JSON Schema from a file/stream

An optional utility is provided to load SchemaSets from a JSON file or stream: SchemaSetLoader
*NOTE:* to avoid adding a new dependency to Curator, the Jackson library has been used with "provided" scope.
You will need to add a dependency to jackson-core and jackson-databind to your project.

The JSON stream should be an array of named schemas:

{code}
[
   {
       "name": "name",                       required - name of the schema
       "path": "path or pattern",            required - full path or regex pattern
       "isRegex": true/false,                optional - true if path is a regular expression - default is false
       "dataValidator": "name",              optional - name of a data validator - default is no validator
       "documentation": "docs",              optional - user displayable docs - default is ""
       "ephemeral": "allowance",             optional - "can", "must" or "cannot" - default is "can"
       "sequential": "allowance",            optional - "can", "must" or "cannot" - default is "can"
       "watched": "allowance",               optional - "can", "must" or "cannot" - default is "can"
       "canBeDeleted": "true/false           optional - true if ZNode at path can be deleted - default is true
   }
]
{code}

h2. Examples

h3. Example 1

{code}
[
    {
        "name": "test",
        "path": "/a/b/c",
        "ephemeral": "must",
        "sequential": "cannot"
    }
]
{code}

* This SchemaSet has only 1 schema
* The schema applies only to the path "/a/b/c"
* The ZNode "/a/b/c" must be ephemeral, cannot be sequential, can be watched, and can be deleted

h3. Example 2

{code}
[
    {
        "name": "test",
        "path": "/a/b/c",
        "ephemeral": "must",
        "sequential": "cannot"
    },

    {
        "name": "test2",
        "path": "/a/.*",
        "isRegex": true,
        "dataValidator": "test"
        "ephemeral": "cannot",
        "canBeDeleted": false
    }
]
{code}

* This SchemaSet has 2 schemas
* The first schema applies only to the path "/a/b/c"
* The ZNode "/a/b/c" must be ephemeral, cannot be sequential, can be watched, and can be deleted
* The second schema is regex and applies to any path that matches the expression "/a/.\*"
* The ZNodes that match "/a/.\*" cannot be ephemeral, can be sequential, can be watched, and cannot be deleted
* The second schema also has a data validator. The data validator named "test" (configured when constructing the SchemaSetLoader) will
be called to validate data for ZNodes that match "/a/.\*" when create() or setData() are called.
